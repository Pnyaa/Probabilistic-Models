# Probabilistic Models

This repository contains the results of practical work carried out as part of a course on the use of Probabilistic Models in machine learning.
* [The first work](./BayesianClassification) is an introduction to Bayesian classification, with an application to signal processing
* [The second work](./ImageSegmentation) focuses on image denoising by modelling the original and noisy images as independent or as observations of a Hidden Markov Model.
* [The third work](./RBM) is a more open study of an Energy-Based Model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, of which the generative properties are studied on the MNIST dataset.
